## Why the name `cone`?

I was looking for a name from the history of ledgers and accounting. I
was also hoping to find a name that somehow connected with Dart and
Flutter.

Looking at cuneiform as an aspect of accounting history, I liked that
the cuneiform sign for one looked a little like a dart, and the
cuneiform sign for ten looked a little like the Flutter logo.

I then looked for ideas in the etymology of cuneiform, and noted that
"cunei" shared some etymology with "cone". I liked cone because it is
a short and familiar word, easy to pronounce. I also liked how mathy
it sounds, since certainly the ledger-likes are quite mathy. Further,
the tip of a dart might be cone shaped.

Further, I found that before cuneiform, people used tokens to track
items, and some of those tokens were cone shaped. Some believe that
the first cuneiform were impressions of for example these conical
tokens into the clay tablets.

Regarding the connection to cuneiform, a few humorous points. One,
many people might find this whole business of command line and text
files primitive, as cuneiform is. Two, the intent in using Dart is to
try to propel the use of ledger-likes onto mobile devices and GUI apps
in general. And so, we hope to make ledger-likes more usable on
tablets, though they might not be clay this time.
